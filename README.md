# San Jose Food Truck Permits

This [Code for San Jose]() project is to create a central resource & webpage where the San Jose's Food Truck community can better navigate how to attain permits in downtown San Jose.
  * Nathaniel Echeverria (Business Development Manager @
    [San Jose Downtown Association][2]) originally proposed this project at the [Civic Hack Night] [1]
    for Code for San Jose on August 11, 2016.
